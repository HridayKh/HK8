Which component talks to whihc component
components: PC, IR, PSR, MAR, MEM, RF1, RF2, ALU, OUT
> all are 16-Bit other than PSR, ALU and, OUT; which are 4-Bit
> getting data from RF1, RF2 means IR decidec whihch regiser is RF1, RF2, not listed below
> ALU and out means setting whihc register is the output register of ALU, segmetn out

notation: A -> B: A sets value of B but B doesnt A
